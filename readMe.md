# Abstract
**Rock! Paper! Scissors! GO!** [THIS](https://lseward0421.github.io/rockPaperScissors/) application allows the user to play against the computer for a 'classic' game of Rock ü™®, Paper üìù, Scissors ‚úÇÔ∏è AND a 'difficult' version with an Iguana ü¶é and Alien üëΩ. The user can switch between games during a single round without resetting the scores. The game will reset once a final winner is determined (best of 5).

# Learning Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
  - The difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
  - Use a problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and not rely on an outside ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a logical challenge

# Wins & Challenges
  - Building out the classes and their methods to update the Data Model seperately and THEN connect/update the DOM was a big win. This involved strategic console logs and proficient use of the dev tools. 
  - Building out a timeline and work flow to build on each iteration was paramount in ensuring key features were not missed. 
  - Troubleshooting bugs, like disabling the change game button during a set timeout, helped my understanding of better user error handling. 
  - The biggest challenge was trying to write DRY non-repetitive code.
  - I found difficulty, in the beginning, of ensuring that I was making atomic commits on appropriate branches to properly document my flow. 

  # Future Iterations
  - Allow the user to pick their own token/emoji and update their name
  - Add another game version with even more fighters to choose from
  - Add local storage
